Dependency Updates

0.8.0 - (KSP 1.2)
------------------
Interim fix for landing leg - this has been moved to act like a basic stabilizer (i.e. an animation vs. using the new wheel code).  So for now, use the animation and bind to the landing gear action group.  A more permanent solution will be evaluated at a later date.
Fixed an issue where the intake transform for the atmospheric scoops was reversed
Karry Kans now include monopropellant

BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS - KARBONITE ROCKET ENGINES:
Karbonite rocket engines have the benefit of significantly higher thrust than other engines in their size class (generally one tier higher).  They have the disadvantage of reduced ISP and increased heat generation.  

Additionally, all KREs now feature the Monoprop collector that until now was exclusively a feature of the 0.625m engine.



BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS - SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS:
Karbonite SRBs have the benefit of significantly higher thrust than their solidfuel counterparts, and may also be refilled.  They have the disadvantage of being slightly unstable (this has been significantly reduced in this update), increased heat generation, and low ISP.

BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS - ATMOSPHERIC ENGINES:
Karbonite Prop/Jet Engines have the benefits of slightly better thrust and the ability to operate in non-oxygen atmospheres.  Their downsides are decreased efficiency due to fuel mass, reduced ISP, and higher heat generation.
 
The included LF Jet Engines are now slightly beefier (and heavier) than the stock TRE, but with an atmospheric curve similar to the BJE.
The LF propfan has thrust between the BJE and TRE, but excellent fuel efficiency at the cost of being a subsonic engine, so ideal for low-speed long-range cruising.

Karbonite Jet/Prop engines have a 20% thrust increase, and 100% heat generation increase when compared to their LF counterparts.
